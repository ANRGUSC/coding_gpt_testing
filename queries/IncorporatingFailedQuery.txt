Write a python program to do the following please, and put this program in a json object as the value 
corresponding to the key `code'.

Solve a given equation and return the value of `x' in the form of string "x=#value". The equation contains 
only `+', `-' operation, the variable `x' and its coefficient.

If there is no solution for the equation, return "No solution".

If there are infinite solutions for the equation, return "Infinite solutions".

If there is exactly one solution for the equation, we ensure that the value of `x' is an integer.


Example 1:
Input: "x+5-3+x=6+x-2"
Output: "x=2"

Example 2:
Input: "x=x"
Output: "Infinite solutions"

Example 3:
Input: "2x=x"
Output: "x=0"

Example 4:
Input: "2x+3x-6x=x+2"
Output: "x=-1"

Example 5:
Input: "x=x+2"
Output: "No solution"

Here is a test case that the previous program failed because ValueError: invalid literal for int() with 
base 10: `+' constant += int(term) Line 58 in get_coefficient_and_constant (Solution.py) left_coefficient, 
left_constant = self.get_coefficient_and_constant(left_side) Line 9 in solveEquation (Solution.py) 
ret = Solution().solveEquation(param_1) Line 79 in _driver (Solution.py) _driver() Line 90 in <module> 
(Solution.py). Please write code with this test case in mind, and error in mind.  

Write code that fits the following template. Please put this program in a json object as the value 
corresponding to the key `code'. 

The program should continue below the following lines:
class Solution:
    def solveEquation(self, equation: str) -> str:

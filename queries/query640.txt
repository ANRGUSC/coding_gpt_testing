You are asked to write a python program to do the following, as a two-step process. First write a pseudo-code for this program in natural language, taking into account what is the input, what is the desired output and look at the examples given. Analyze your pseudo-code for any possible mistakes and fix them in the following second step. In the second step, write a python program to do the following, and put this program in a json object as the value corresponding to the key 'code'.
Solve a given equation and return the value of `x` in the form of string "x=#value". The equation contains only '+', '-' operation, the variable `x` and its coefficient.

If there is no solution for the equation, return "No solution".

If there are infinite solutions for the equation, return "Infinite solutions".

If there is exactly one solution for the equation, we ensure that the value of `x` is an integer.


Example 1:
Input: "x+5-3+x=6+x-2"
Output: "x=2"

Example 2:
Input: "x=x"
Output: "Infinite solutions"

Example 3:
Input: "2x=x"
Output: "x=0"

Example 4:
Input: "2x+3x-6x=x+2"
Output: "x=-1"

Example 5:
Input: "x=x+2"
Output: "No solution"

Write code that fits the following template. Please put this program in a json object as the value corresponding to the key 'code'. The program should continue below the following lines:
class Solution:
    def solveEquation(self, equation: str) -> str:

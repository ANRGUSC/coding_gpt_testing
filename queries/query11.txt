Write a python program to do the following, and put this program in a json object as the value corresponding to the key 'code'. You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
The program should continue below the following lines:
